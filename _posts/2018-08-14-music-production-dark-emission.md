Dark Emission is a music I composed in summer 2018. I wanted to give a sense of repetition but at the same time progression, this is why I used only two chords, G Major and G Minor, in the music, but added a variety of instruments, from the piano at the start to the synth at then end. I also made sure to insert breaks in the music, going from multiple instruments to just the piano and a hat, but then make it grow again until the end.

After the second break at around 1:13, to give this growing aspect, I also added more and more frequents beats, supporting the piano going faster until the synth starts playing.

In the end, that was a very fun project to make that I really enjoyed doing and from which I learned a lot.
