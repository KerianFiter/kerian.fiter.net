### What is COLORED about?

COLORED is a simple arcade game developed for mobile where you need to match colors to stay alive. It's quite challenging and includes 5 levels of difficulty, an endless mode and customizables elements such as your character or the color palette.

### When was it developed?

COLORED is a mobile game I developed from April 2017 to about September when it was released. I then added new features until November 2017. Almost every day after school from April to the end of June and during the summer, I developed COLORED.

### How came the idea?

I remember waking up in the middle of the night, taking a pen and sketching the basics of the game on a random sheet of paper I found. Then the next day I started to create the game. 

### What softwares did I use?

I developed the game on a very popular engine called Unity3D, which uses the C# (or C Sharp) programmation language. It provides awesome tools for game development, and is very efficient when it comes to developing mobile games. I also used Blender, which is a very powerful and open source software, to make some of the 3D models in the game (I also got some help with that from a friend of mine, Gwendal Richomme). I also made some of the UI, such as buttons, and the logo of COLORED with Photoshop and Gimp.

### What did I learn during this project?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I had never made a game and published it on my own before, so it has been a really rewarding experience for me. I learned in the process of making the game, searching for answers on the web, looking for ways to optimize the game and the code, acquired new knowledge on things I wouldn't have thought of like color theory, even if it seems obvious now. I also got interested in many other subjects related to game development such as music composition, 3D modelisation, and art in general, as developing a game requires to know and to have knowledge in a lot of different fields.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As I'm looking back on this project more than a year and a half later, in december 2018, I'm considering the project as the trigger of all the creative things I've done since then, like starting to write novels, making music, learning photography... but also non-creative things like improving my english (even though it's not perfect).
