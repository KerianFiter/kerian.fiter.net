[ROMA by Alfonso Cuarón][1] is not the kind of movie you are used to watch. In fact, it really stood out from all the films I have seen so far.

I am not going to persuade you watch the movie, because you may not enjoy it. You also may not be in the right place at the right time to watch it. But I'm putting this here just to highlight the fact that Roma was a really moving experience. And if you happen to watch it (or if you already did), I highly suggest you as well watch the video below explaining the meaning of Roma.
